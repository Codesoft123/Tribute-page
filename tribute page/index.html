                        Dr. B.R.Ambedkar was brought into the world in Mhow of Madhya Pradesh. His dad was Ramji Makoji
                        Sakpal, who was a military official in the English India armed force. Dr. B.R.Ambedkar was the
                        fourteenth child of his dad. Bhimabai Sakpal was his mom. His family was of Marathi foundation
                        from the town of Ambawade. Dr. B. R.Ambedtkar was brought into the world as a Dalit and he was
                        treated as a distant. He was exposed to ordinary social and monetary separation. In spite of the
                        fact that Ambedkar went to class, he and other Dalit understudies were treated as untouchables.
                        They were isolated from one more gathering of understudies from other position and were not
                        focused on consideration by the educators. They were even not permitted to sit with different

                        was the one in particular who finished his assessment and went to secondary school. Later in
                        secondary school, his school, a Brahmin educator, changed his last name from Ambadawekar, which
                        was given by his dad to Ambedkar in records. This shows the degree of separation that was
